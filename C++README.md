# CMSC313-HW8-CVCPP

The purpose of this C++ program is to operate and modify matrices.
This program can be easily applied to many different types of applications.

Build Instructions:
I built this file using the g++ compiler. 
My exact gl command to compile this file was: "g++ -Wall -g matrixLib.cpp -o matrix" (as is seen in my submitted screenshot).

Testing:
Each function in this file was tested with a few general and edge cases so that they would be adequate for basic matrix operations.
Since this model is very user dependent, it assumes a level of user knowledge and intuition.

Each function has comments briefly describing the purpose of the function, lines of code, and variables (if the variable name is not self explanatory).
The "main" file has the given equation's situation prepared and ready to be executed.

The given functions are as follows:
insert, addMatrix, subtractMatrix, multiplyMatrix, scalarMultiplication, and transposeMatrix. 
Along with "dump" which is used for debugging, and "print" which is used to picture the matrices in the equation.
